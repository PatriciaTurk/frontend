    <h2>Cookies that measure website usage</h2>
    <p>We use Google Analytics software (Universal Analytics) to collect information about how you use GOV.UK. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users and to help us make improvements.</p>
    <p>Google Analytics stores information about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the pages you visit on GOV.UK</li>
      <li>how long you spend on each GOV.UK page</li>
      <li>how you got to the site</li>
      <li>what you click on while you're visiting the site</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do not collect or store your personal information (for example your name or address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.</p>

    <p>We sometimes test different versions of pages with different users to see which work better. We’ll save a cookie so that you consistently see the same version when browsing GOV.UK.</p>
    <p>The cookie name will change but will be in the form ‘ABTest-[Test name]’ where the ‘Test name’ describes which part of GOV.UK is being tested.</p>
    <p>This type of cookie will usually expire after between 1 and 4 weeks, but this may be longer for more in-depth tests.</p>
